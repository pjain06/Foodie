                 Foodie focuses on recipes and events of cooking. 
                 It allows users to post cooking recipes, to review and grade posted cooking recipes, to add additional suggestions to a posted recipe, and to organize cooking meetings with other users. 
                 A user has a unique name and their details with a profile photo. Users can post recipes that are then visible to other users. 
                 A recipe has a title (e.g., “Aunt Mary’s Apple Pie”), number of servings, the ingredients and their quantities, a textual description of how to make the food item, and one or more pictures of the dish. 
                 A recipe can also be linked to another related recipe.
                 A recipe can have multiple tags which defines the type of recipes E.g. “Italian’’, “Chinese”, “vegan”, “soup”, “spicy”, etc. (we assume that these tags are pre-defined by admin and the user who posts a recipe can apply the tags that they feel are relevant to the recipe).
